# Posts App

An application to create listings for the available programming jobs.

## Details

This app allows to view the list of available positions in Full-Time and Freelance / Temporary categories. Users can create and edit their accounts as well as add and edit listings.

Currently the application is in Work In Progress state as I'm mostly interested to see at what scale I can refactor the project and how all of the components of the application work togethter.

Due to this the project and its current [live version](https://rad-sundae-cd883a.netlify.app/) may change in the future.

## Main functionality

### Main page

- A carousel with featured listings to navigate to each one
- A section with two main categories for the listings
- A footer to navigate to the Profile or Explore pages

### Profile page

- A sign-in page with password reset functionality and option to create an account by signing up

### Listings

- A separate page for each created listing with job description and carousel with images at the top

### Misc

- Users can edit they info as well as created listings in the Profile section
- The app uses Firebase/Firestore and at the moment deployed with Netlify (this may change in the future)

## Built with

# Posts App (Work In Progress)

An application to create listings for the available programming jobs.

## Details

This application was built after remaking one of the previous projects from the React course on Udemy. Initial version is available [here](https://github.com/Dimterion/House-marketplace).

The app allows to view the list of available positions in Freelance and Full-Time categories. Users can create/edit their accounts as well as add/edit listings.

Currently the application is in Work In Progress state as I'm mostly interested to see at what scale I can refactor the course project and how all of the components of the application work togethter.

Due to this there's currently no live demo (it may be added at some point in the future).

## Built with

React, React Router, Firebase, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
